# Explanation of Music Theme: Feedback

The theme of feedback can be simply interpreted as

- (in terms of form) repeatation, which is the echo of sound;
- (in terms of sense) the reaction correspond to some melodies.

I try to use these two techniques in my musical compositions to explain the theme of feedback.

## Brief Introduction

In this musical composition, I use 13 different instruments to create a sense of feedback, including brass, bass, drums, string, horn, harp and some effects. These instruments can be divided into three groups: melody, harmony and rhythm. The melody is played by brass, horn and harp, the harmony is played by string and bass, and the rhythm is played by drums. Other sound effects play a role of decoration.

## Explanation of Feedback

At the beginning of the music, I mainly use string to create an atmosphere of space, empty and quiet. Then followed by the brass, saw, and horn to introduce a melody twice with high pitch and intense. It is a response to the current atmosphere, which means something will happen. After that comes a more soothing harmony played by the string and harp. This means that the event is continuing.

The melody-hamony is repeated twice, to express the echo in the space. While the second time, I change the rythm of celeste to create a more intense harmony, which is exactly the feedback of the first time in terms of sense.

Then I insert a long melody mainly played by harp, sound effect of Glowing Filaments and glockenspiel. In this clip, I made heavy use of the *echo* technique of delaying a bar and then overlapping them together.

At the beginning of two melodies, I inserted the instrument *syn1* made by MaxMSP, in order to create a sound effect of "a fast fly-through" with an echo.

In the end, multiple instruments play together to create a sense of echo and feedback, which is the termination of the music.
